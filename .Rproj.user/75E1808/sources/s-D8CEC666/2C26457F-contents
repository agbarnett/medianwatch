title: Why start blogging now?
---

The title for this blog is stolen from the ABC show "[Media Watch](https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/])" which critiques the Australian media and is never short of content. Similarly there's a lot wrong in the world of statistics, so this blog is mainly about the use and misuse of statistics.

I've got a post coming on how my research has been misused by those trying to deny the climate crisis. I also want to write about some statistical mistakes I've made in published papers, which I realise may just help the climate change propagandists to undermine my credibility!

I was inspired by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io) to start this blog, thanks to her great talk at [YSC2019](https://ysc2019.netlify.com). The blog theme was borrowed with permission from [Zhao Huabing](https://zhaohuabing.com).
