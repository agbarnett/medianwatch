These are some abandoned ideas that are free for others to re-use. These were things that I thought about, but now no longer have the time to pursue. Some of them are getting a bit old, and I haven't checked to see if they have already been published by others.

I stole this idea from the economist Paul Frijters who put his own abandoned ideas on [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20150219074204/http://paulfrijters.com/research/abandoned-projects/). I use the same approach as Paul:

## Statistics / epidemiology

* **Two-stage estimates in environmental epidemiology**. I've used a two-stage regression model to estimate the additional effects of an environmental exposure. For example, [in this paper](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/uploads/1/3/8/6/13864925/barnett_envres2012.pdf) we used a two-stage model to estimate the effects of temperature and on deaths, and then examined the additional effect of heat waves in a second stage. The problem is that the first stage estimates are carried forward with no uncertainty. This could easily be fixed by using a bootstrap or Bayesian model in the first stage and re-running the second stage multiple times using lots of first-stage estimates.

## Meta-research

* Which journal first moved materials and methods to an appendix? When did this happen and why?

* Does the time between a paper being received and being published impact on its subsequent citation count? The idea is that papers which sail through peer review in quick time may be "better" (on average). A quick first look at this shows that errata throw a spanner in the works, as they interfere with the study's dates.
