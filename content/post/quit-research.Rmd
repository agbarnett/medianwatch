After yet another failed fellowship application I considered if I should leave research. I now have seven fellowship failures and no successes, and that seems like a lot.

Success rates for grants are nose-diving and even the former head of the NHMRC says that [researchers should be considering other careers](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/medical-phds-need-to-look-beyond-research-careers/news-story/f85cf01faa6a259d986395c7024dbf53) (pay-walled). I’ve spent a lot of time running research projects for no money, but working for no money is a luxury I can’t afford.

As a statistician I knew I could get a more objective answer of whether seven failures really is a lot. I used a Bayesian approach by creating a prior distribution of researchers and then adding my own data to get a posterior probability that I should quit. I decided I would quit if there was a more than 90% probability that I am in the bottom half of the talent pool. In other words, if there’s a high probability that I am below average.

My prior distribution aimed to capture the likely range in researcher quality. So I needed to think of the average researcher and the range in ability. If you think it’s a horrible idea to assign a number to researcher quality, then you should never apply for research funding. As a compromise we can call it the prior the distribution of researchers’ ability to write a good fellowship application, without opening the can of snakes of whether that’s actually well correlated with talent.

Here’s my prior:

```{r}
# key parameters
mean.prob = 0.2
prior.success = 1
# prior
prior.failures = (prior.success/mean.prob) - prior.success
theta = seq(0, 0.8, 0.001)
n.prior = length(theta)
prior = dbeta(x=theta, shape1=prior.success+1, shape2=prior.failures+1) # beta
prior = prior / sum(prior) # normalise
# starting probability of being in the bottom half
start = pbeta(mean.prob, shape1=prior.success+1, shape2=prior.failures+1)
for.plot.prior = data.frame(theta=theta, prior=prior)
prior_plot = ggplot(data=for.plot.prior, aes(x=theta, y=prior))+
  geom_area(alpha=0.3, position='identity')+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Probability of winning fellowship")+
  ylab('Probability density')+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean.prob, col=cbPalette[4], size=1.1)+
  geom_text(aes(x=0.07, y=0, label='Plodder'), vjust=0, size=7)+
  geom_text(aes(x=0.7, y=0, label='Genius'), vjust=0, size=7)+
  theme(plot.margin=unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), "mm"), legend.position=c(0.8, 0.8),
        text=element_text(size = 20))
prior_plot
```

I wanted to have an average probability of success of `r mean.prob`, as that was about the average success of the schemes I had applied to. Then it’s logical to think of a few brilliant researchers, a few less than brilliant ones and most clumped around the mean. By trial and error I created the above prior, which is a Beta distribution (1,4), meaning that an average researcher would have 1 success and 5 attempts. If you understand this perfectly then you’re probably in the top half of the distribution.

Combining my data and the prior gives me this posterior:

```{r}
n.fail = 7 # my failures
# posterior is beta by conjugacy
n.attempts = n.fail
post = dbeta(x=theta, shape1=prior.success+1+0, shape2=prior.failures+1+n.attempts-0) 
post = post/sum(post)
for.plot.posterior = data.frame(theta=theta, post=post, n.attempts=n.attempts)
# probability in bottom half
prob = pbeta(mean.prob , shape1=prior.success+1+0, shape2=prior.failures+1+n.attempts-0)
bottom = data.frame(n.attempts=n.attempts, prob=prob)
## plot prior plus posterior
for.plot.prior$group = 'Prior'
for.plot.posterior$group = 'Posterior'
for.plot.posterior = subset(for.plot.posterior, select=c('theta', 'post', 'group')) # to help with merge
names(for.plot.posterior)[2] = 'prior'
for.plot.prior.posterior = rbind(for.plot.prior, for.plot.posterior)
pplot = ggplot(data=for.plot.prior.posterior, aes(x=theta, y=prior, fill=group))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_area(alpha=0.3, position='identity')+
  xlab("Probability of winning fellowship")+
  ylab('Probability density')+
  scale_fill_manual(name=NULL, values=cbPalette[2:3])+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean.prob, col=cbPalette[4], size=1.1)+
  geom_text(aes(x=0.07, y=0, label='Plodder'), vjust=0, size=7)+
  geom_text(aes(x=0.7, y=0, label='Genius'), vjust=0, size=7)+
  theme(plot.margin=unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), "mm"), legend.position=c(0.8, 0.8),
        text=element_text(size = 20))
pplot
```

There is a `r round(bottom$prob*100)`% probability that I am in the bottom half, so I stay in research by a margin of `r 100-round(bottom$prob*100)`%. Sadly the evidence tells me that there’s an almost zero probability that I am a genius, and a relatively high probability that I am a plodder. Twelve failures are needed to reach the 90% margin, so the message for other people who have had multiple failures is: don’t give up hope yet.

Of course if (when) I do reach the 90% probability threshold then I’ll just move the goalposts to being 95% sure, which moves the failure threshold up to 16. Or if I do eventually quit research at least it will be a partly evidence-based decision.

If you want to run your own failure history, there's a shiny app [here](https://aushsi.shinyapps.io/quit/).
