<h2>My values are not p-values</h2>
<p>One year ago after another stupid fight with a journal about p-values, I made <a href="https://medianwatch.netlify.app/post/pvalue_pledge/">a pledge to go without them for a year</a>. Here’s a reflection on how it went.</p>
</div>
<div id="but-first-why" class="section level2">
<h2>But first, why?</h2>
<p>I am aware of the arguments for and against p-values. I have used p-values for a long while and they can be a useful statistic.</p>
<p>The reason I ditched them is because almost nobody in health and medical research interprets them correctly, wrongly thinking they reveal the probability that the null hypothesis is true. This misinterpretation leads to them being used to judge the entire scientific validity and quality of a study. Putting p-values on a pedestal has multiple consequences including p-hacking, publication bias and a lack of scrutiny of other more important parts of study design and results.</p>
<p>I’ve tried teaching my colleagues about the limitations of p-values and they have nodded politely and said they understood. Then draft papers have come back with little p-values doing all the heavy lifting. “We understand the limitations Adrian, but the journal reviewers won’t so we need the p-values in.”</p>
<p>It’s a grandiose analogy, but I’m reminded of nuclear power: fine in theory, but terrible when combined with people. I’ve switched to cleaner forms of generating energy and evidence.</p>
</div>
<div id="little-victories" class="section level2">
<h2>Little victories</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m claiming victory.</p>
<p>I had very different conversations with colleagues when I told them you can have the p-values or me as an author, but not both. Although this was an ultimatum I was cordial and let my colleagues know that their decision would not upset me or harm our working relationship.</p>
<p>In every case but one the authors removed the p-values, but what was more satisfying is that it spurred some useful conversations about p-values and their limitations. My willingness to forgo that most precious of academic credit of a paper meant the seriousness of the issue finally penetrated.</p>
<p>For the one paper where my colleagues preferred the p-values the paper was accepted and is in press. Deliciously the acknowledgement section reads: “Thanks to Adrian Barnett who would have been an author but it was him or the p-values.” Let’s hope that gets through the copy editors.</p>
<p>My pledge also got discussed on a <a href="https://populationhealthexchange.org/fa-episode-083/">medical research podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Dogma-fight</h2>
<p>I realise that I am fighting dogma with dogma, which is not ideal.</p>
<p>I am likely going to continue to eschew p, as .</p>
