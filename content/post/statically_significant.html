<p>A colleague sent me a draft manuscript with the typo “statically significant”. A typo that passes a spell check, but would surely not pass reviewers and editors?</p>
<p>Oh dear, a quick search of <em>PubMed</em> reveals that it has snuck past reviewers and editors, many many times. There are 975 abstracts that have used the phrase. We should have a celebration for the 1000th paper!</p>

<p>Surely that’s only in the terrible journals though? Well only if you consider JAMA to be one of the terrible journals (abstract <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36472594/">here</a>).</p>
<p>It has also happened in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725252/">BMJ Open</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37173653">BMC Surgery</a>, and — of all places — <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35530430">Reading and Writing</a>, which “publishes high-quality scientific articles pertaining to the processes, acquisition, and loss of reading and writing skills” and is also contributing to that loss.</p>
<p>“statically” is a good word, it often gets paired with “charged”. Like statically charged hair from a Van de Graaff Generator.</p>
<p>“statistically” is a good word, it often gets paired with “significant”, to the detriment of both.</p>
<p>So there’s another level of hell when it comes to “statistical significance”, and that’s nearly 1000 people not even able to spell their poorly conceived ideas.</p>
