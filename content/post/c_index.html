<h3>Show me the shortcut</h3>
<p>Scientists are busy people. Busy people love a short-cut because it gives them more time to be busy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://medianwatch.netlify.app/post/pvalue_pledge/">p-value</a> is a well-used scientific short-cut. It can decide for us whether something is important or not, and it’s based on an equation so it must be right.</p>
<p>Another heaven-sent shortcut is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">h-index</a> which allows us to decide the careers of researchers based on just one number (also made by an equation).
How can that be possible? Well the higher your h-index the better scientist you are because it counts the number of highly cited papers you have. If you have a h-index of 50 that means you’ve published 50 papers with 50 or more citations, simples.</p>
<p>What’s that you say? What about co-authored papers? What about the fact that most citations are just filler? What about the fact that older scientists have higher h-index’s just by virtue of being alive longer? What about the quality of the work rather than the quantity? What about scientists who greedily self-cite?</p>
<p>Sorry, we don’t have time to answer those questions.</p>

<div id="one-index-to-rule-them-all" class="section level3">
<h3>One index to rule them all</h3>
<p>Okay, so I admit there are <em>some</em> semi-serious problems with the h-index. Which is why I’ve invented a new index called the c-index, short for the cartoon-index. (I will consider naming it the equally catchy abc-index for the “Adrian Barnett Cartoon index” if there’s enough public pressure.)</p>
<p>How is it calculated? The equation is simple, it’s the number of cartoons that have been drawn about your research. Cartoons show genuine engagement with your work, and so are a true measure on non-academic impact. The phrase “Holy Grail” is over-used in science, but objectively measuring non-academic impact into one single number is surely a Holy Grail.</p>
<p>This new index will likely come to dominate the science of scientific index making from today, which is also known as “Scientoshortcuts”.</p>

<div id="whats-my-c-index" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s my c-index?</h3>
<p>I have an outstanding c-index of 3. With cartoons by <a href="https://firstdogonthemoon.com.au/cartoons/2013/03/26/we-could-be-enjoying-science-from-the-year-2413-right-now/">First Dog on the Moon</a>, Cathy Wilcox (I can’t find a link, but trust me), and <a href="https://www.scienceindoses.com/2020/09/acronyms-are-new-jargon.html">Science-In-Doses</a>.</p>
<p>Only a fool would invent an index for which they have a score of zero, unless it’s a retraction index.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-improvements" class="section level3">
<h3>Future improvements</h3>
<p>Of course the c-index is not quite perfect, I anticipate adaptions of the c-index that incorporate the sentiment of the cartoon, the readership size where the cartoon was published, and the number of colours used.</p>
<p>Researchers like <a href="https://hildabastian.net/">Hilda Bastian</a> who draw their own cartoons will be disqualified. So it’s already better than the h-index which includes self-citations.</p>
</div>
<div id="farewell-to-the-h-index" class="section level3">
<h3>Farewell to the h-index</h3>
<p>So farewell to the h-index, you’ve had a good run. We shall wave you goodbye using our middle - not index - finger.</p>
