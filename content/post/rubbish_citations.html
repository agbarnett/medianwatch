<h3>Blog pause</h3>
<p>It’s been a long while between blogs. I won’t bore you with how busy I’ve been, but one thing that’s kept me away from the fun of writing blogs is the “fun” of writing grants.</p>

<h3>Beans</h3>
<p>To get more research funding we rightly have to explain the impact of our past funding.
It’s possible to get examples of impact by seeing how other researchers have cited your work.</p>
<p>The tool <a href="https://scite.ai">scite.ai</a> is handy for this, as it gives the context of the citation and attempts to categorise it as ‘supporting’, ‘mentioning’ or ‘disputing’.
Try it and you’ll likely see how the vast majority of citations to your work are in the ‘mentioning’ category.
I’ve found that most citations are just filler, with throwaway sentences like, “Past research has shown that disease <em>X</em> is of growing importance in country <em>Z</em> [1-11]”.</p>
<p>Should I take comfort from being paper number 1 in this group of 11? Probably not considering my surname’s alphabetical advantage.</p>
<p>Looking at how my work has been cited makes me think that the many “impact” statistics based on citations are no more than a hill of beans.</p>

<h3>Diamonds</h3>
<p>Saying that, you can unearth a diamond in all this coal, because you might find a citation where another research group has tried to replicate your work or based their whole study on your idea.</p>
<p>But it’s mostly coal.</p>

<h3>Fool’s gold</h3>
<p>Looking for diamonds, I found a citation to <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2019/211/10/biostatistics-fundamental-discipline-core-modern-health-data-science">a paper</a> I wrote with my statistical colleagues about the shortage of statistical skills in Australia. I’m very biased, but I think this paper makes an important point about how a lot of current research in Australia is undermined by poor statistical analysis. So it’s nice to see it cited, presumably by those who agree with this important message.</p>
<p>The citation is from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haider-Alsaedi/publication/346681415_The_Possible_Nephroprotective_Effect_of_Roflumilast_Ameliorating_Glycerol_-Induced_Myoglobinuric_Acute_Renal_Injury_in_Rabbits_Model/links/5fce7e1c92851c00f85b853a/The-Possible-Nephroprotective-Effect-of-Roflumilast-Ameliorating-Glycerol-Induced-Myoglobinuric-Acute-Renal-Injury-in-Rabbits-Model.pdf">this paper</a> and is [sic]: “P value is considered significant when its value equal or less than 0.05(18).”</p>
<p>It’s hard to work out why we’ve been cited, as we didn’t even discuss the problem of p-values in this paper. If we had done then this sentence would have been a classic example of the sort of bad statistics that we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>In one way it’s a valid citation to our paper, because it supports the point we were trying to make: A lot of health and medical researchers have only a shallow understanding of statistics.</p>
