<div id="sorry-state" class="section level1">
<h1>Sorry state</h1>
<p>A few years ago I thought about writing an article that apologised to the public about the poor state of health and medical research. The public pay for this research and give their time and data, and yet often the results provided by research are totally unreliable.</p>
<p>In the end I bottled it; too worried about the harm to my career. But today I’ve read <a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(21)00170-0/fulltext">this important paper</a> from a group of statistical colleagues and it’s given me the nerve to speak up.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-quotable-paper" class="section level1">
<h1>A quotable paper</h1>
<p>Here’s a key quote from the paper: “the scientific enterprise is doing a major disservice to patients and society.”</p>
<p>Why are scientists doing so badly? Because we are too focused on our own careers and not enough on the health and wellbeing of society. Because the “best” journals demand interesting results, and so we provide them regardless of how unreliable those results are. Because the universities and funders promote bad practice by focusing on daft metrics that mean we get rewarded for quantity instead of quality, so we cut corners in order to keep up.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-personal" class="section level1">
<h1>It’s personal</h1>
<p>A personal apology feels appropriate because I’ve witnessed the many current problems in science for over two decades and watched things get worse without doing enough to stop it.</p>
<p>Just in the last month I’ve been involved in enervating struggles on inappropriate authorship and inappropriate re-analysis of existing results. I also reviewed a paper that was so bad it felt like it was written in an afternoon or even by an algorithm. I’ve also been reading about growing fraud in research, from paper mills to image manipulation, and a scientist brave enough to speak up about these issues <a href="https://osf.io/2awsv/">is being hassled and sued</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-are-part-of-the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>You are part of the problem</h1>
<p>Writing about rich people don’t recognise that they are rich, the comedian David Mitchell said “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/23/david-mitchell-rich-shame-70000-john-mcdonnell-squeezed-middle">Hardly any of us think we’re part of the problem, which is part of the problem</a>”.</p>
<p>The same is true is science. We all rationalise our bad practices because it’s easy to think of someone who is worse.</p>
<p>If you are a scientist reading this, then you are part of the problem. I am part of the problem. None of us are doing enough to stop this deluge of poor quality research. A deluge that became a double-deluge during the pandemic, because they was even less time for careful scientific practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-optimistic-note" class="section level1">
<h1>An optimistic note</h1>
<p>Can I end on an optimistic note? No. I have little optimism that things will get better soon.</p>
<p>Here’s another quote from the paper that rang true: “methodological illiteracy is still accepted.”</p>
<p>So many researchers I work with want p-values, but when I ask them to define them, they can’t. But they still want them in their papers, even though neither they nor the reviewers or readers understand them. This is madness.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.aushsi.org.au/training/statistics-course/">one-day statistics course</a> that’s teaches researchers what p-values are and helps them avoid other common blunders. But I’m told that it’s too expensive and they can’t take a day away from work. But the costs of poor medical research are massive, likely <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/01/14/paul-glasziou-and-iain-chalmers-is-85-of-health-research-really-wasted/">in the billions</a>. But researchers are only thinking of the costs to their careers, and we are now in such a hyper-competitive environment that even one-day of learning is too high a price.</p>
<p>I can imagine one day fronting a government enquiry about this.</p>
