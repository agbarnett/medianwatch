A colleague sent me a draft manuscript with the typo "statically significant". A typo that passes a spell check, but would surely not pass reviewers and editors?

Oh dear, a quick search of _PubMed_ reveals that it has snuck past reviewers and editors, many many times. There are 975 abstracts that have used this nonsense phrase. We should have a celebration for the 1000th paper!

Surely that's only in the terrible journals though? Well only if you consider JAMA to be  terrible (abstract [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36472594/)).

It has also happened in [BMJ Open](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725252/), [BMC Surgery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37173653), and --- of all places --- [Reading and Writing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35530430), which "publishes high-quality scientific articles pertaining to the processes, acquisition, and loss of reading and writing skills" and is also contributing to that loss.

"statically" is a good word, it often gets paired with "charged". Like statically charged hair from a Van de Graaff Generator.

"statistically" is a good word, it often gets paired with "significant" to the detriment of both. 

I didn't think that the use of "statistical significance" could get any worse, but I was wrong. It's an immovable trope that's become so lazily used that you can throw it down using free-form spelling and still get published. 

All this recent worry about what semi-intelligent machines might write. I'm remain deeply concerned about the writings of actual people.
