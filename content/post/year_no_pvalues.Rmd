One year ago after another stupid fight with a journal about p-values, I made [a pledge to go without them for a year](https://medianwatch.netlify.app/post/pvalue_pledge/). Here's how it went.

## But first, why?

I am aware of the arguments for and against p-values. I have used p-values for a long while and they can be a useful statistic.

The reason I ditched them is because almost nobody in health and medical research interprets them correctly, wrongly thinking they reveal the probability that the null hypothesis is true ([other misinterpretations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18582619/) are available). P-values are on a pedestal and wrongly get used to judge the entire scientific validity and quality of a study. This inflated importance leads to p-hacking and publication bias, which are badly warping evidence-based medicine. 

I've tried teaching my colleagues about the limitations of p-values and they have told me they understood. Then draft papers arrive in my inbox with little p-values doing all the heavy lifting. "We understand the limitations Adrian, but the journal reviewers won't so we need the p-values."

It's a grandiose analogy, but I'm reminded of nuclear power: fine in theory, but terrible when combined with people. I've switched to cleaner forms of generating energy and evidence.

## I'm claiming victory. 

I've had very different conversations with colleagues when I told them you can have the p-values or me as an author, but not both. Although this was an ultimatum I was cordial and let my colleagues know that their decision would not upset me or harm our working relationship. 

In every case but one my colleagues removed the p-values, relying instead on confidence intervals. But what was more satisfying is that it spurred some meaningful conversations about p-values and their limitations. My willingness to forgo that most precious of academic credit of a paper meant that my seriousness finally cut through. 

For the one paper where my colleagues preferred the p-values, the paper was accepted and is in press. Deliciously the acknowledgement section reads: "Thanks to Adrian Barnett who would have been an author but it was him or the p-values." Let's hope that gets through the copy editors. 

My pledge was also discussed on a [medical research podcast](https://populationhealthexchange.org/fa-episode-083/).

I also spoke with some early-career statisticians who wanted to take a similar stand, but couldn't because of power imbalances or the need to build their academic credits. 

## Dogma-fight

I am fighting dogma with dogma. I wish there was another way, but education alone has just not worked for me. I'll continue to educate and I'll also continue to eschew p. "Me or p" not "[T and P](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2017.01021.x)".
