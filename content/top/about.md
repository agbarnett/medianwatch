I am a statistician working at [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au). 
I am a past president of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au).
I am the current president of the [Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science
](https://aimos.community/).
I am interested in improving the quality of research, in particular how researchers use statistics and how research is funded.
