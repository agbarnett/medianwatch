      <description>Sometimes I fantasise about being in an earthquake. Not a big one, just enough to feel the ground shake, to see the earth move for a few seconds.
I should be careful what I wish for. Last Sunday I was in the plughole of a proper natural disaster as massive amounts of rain tried to barge its way into our house. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t any fun. Our house is fine, and other friends have had far worse experiences, but it has knocked me about a bit, and it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to focus on work.</description>
