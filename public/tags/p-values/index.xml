      <description>One year ago after another stupid fight with a journal about p-values, I made a pledge to go without them for a year. Hereâ€™s how it went.
But first, why?I am aware of the arguments for and against p-values. I have used p-values for a long while and they can be a useful statistic.
The reason I ditched them is because almost nobody in health and medical research interprets them correctly, wrongly thinking they reveal the probability that the null hypothesis is true (other misinterpretations are available).</description>
