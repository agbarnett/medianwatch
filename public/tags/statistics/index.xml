      <description>Here’s a great quote about working with statistics from the fantastic statistician David Spiegelhalter “I am often asked why people tend to find probability a difficult and unintuitive idea, and I reply that, after forty years researching and teaching in this area, I have finally concluded that it is because probability really is a difficult and unintuitive idea” (Spiegelhalter 2019).
Statistics can be difficult, and that’s part of what makes it fun.</description>
