For years men have won more funding than women. This disparity in success is driven by a disparity in applications, as women apply far less often. Success rates for men and women are relatively close, so policies to reduce the gender disparity in funding should focus on encouraging more applications from women.","tags":["funding","simulations"],"title":"A 2-for-1 deal for female researchers","type":"post","url":"/post/funding-gender-disparity/","weight":0,"wordcount":1723},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1583107200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/tags/funding/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/funding/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"funding","type":"tags","url":"/tags/funding/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1583107200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"home","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Median Watch","type":"page","url":"/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1583107200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"post","url":"/post/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1583107200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/tags/simulations/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/simulations/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"simulations","type":"tags","url":"/tags/simulations/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1583107200,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomyTerm","lang":"en","lastmod":1583107200,"objectID":"","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/tags/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","type":"tags","url":"/tags/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1582848000,"description":"","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582848000,"objectID":"0acb69d0698982edcb2ab27153c87371","permalink":"https://medianwatch.netlify.com/post/2020-02-28-first-post/","publishdate":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/post/2020-02-28-first-post/","section":"post","summary":"The title for this blog is a homage the ABC TV show \u0026ldquo;Media Watch\u0026rdquo; which critiques the Australian media and is never short of content.
